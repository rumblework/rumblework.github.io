          <h2>A few lines about me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there! My name is Kieran Rummel, and I am a high school student
            with a passion for computer science. I have been fascinated by
            technology since I was a child, and I have spent the past few years
            honing my skills and knowledge in the field of computer science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of my projects are based on Python, Java, and C++, and I am 
            always learning new languages. I have experience in web development,
            and currently manage my <a href="https://www.conantcrier.com">school's newspaper website</a> using WordPress.
          </p>
          <p>
            My future plands include studying computer science, physics, or electrical
            engineering in college, and eventually pursuing a career in software development,
            the tech industry, or in academia.

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
            I have worked on a variety of Python projects, including data analysis
             and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib, web scraping with 
             BeautifulSoup and Selenium, automation scripts to streamline 
             repetitive tasks, and machine learning models utilizing Scikit-learn 
             and TensorFlow. Additionally, I have built web applications with Flask 
             and Django, worked on API integrations, and developed small utility 
             tools to enhance workflow efficiency.

          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p>
            I have developed various Java projects, focusing on building interactive 
            desktop applications using JavaFX and game development with FXGL. My 
            work includes designing dynamic user interfaces, implementing 
            event-driven programming, and integrating multimedia elements in JavaFX. 
            Additionally, I have created 2D games using FXGL, incorporating physics, 
            animations, and game mechanics to deliver engaging experiences.

          <p>
            I'm actively learning C++ by working on projects that focus on 
            object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. I practice 
            problem-solving through competitive coding challenges, explore game 
            development with libraries like SFML, and experiment with low-level memory 
            management to deepen my understanding of the language. Additionally, I am
            study design patterns and modern C++ features to write more efficient and 
            maintainable code.
